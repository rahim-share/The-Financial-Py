# The-Finanical-Py
This is a mini project for week 13, demonstrating application of the ETL process.

Since the beginning of the millennium we have seen two recessions, the financial crash (2008) and the Covid-19 outbreak (2020). Both had a massive effect on the way we live and our economy, we are interested to compare how the two recessions have affected the housing prices and sales volume in the UK.

# The process

We used data from the UK Government website and the Office for National Statistics. In order to extract the data, there were 2 different methods in use; the first  one using Selenium, a python automation module, and the second one using a module called Urllib.request. 

With the extracted data it was cleaned to show only the key columns we desired and set two different date ranges for the new data frames.

Finally, (insert sql bit)
